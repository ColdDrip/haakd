    <p>In Australian Aboriginal art, a Dreaming is a totemistic design or artwork, which can be owned by a tribal group or individual.</p>

<p>A Dreaming is a story owned by different tribes and their members that explains the creation of life, people and animals. A Dreaming story (e.g. Kangaroo Dreaming, or Shark Dreaming, or Honey Ant Dreaming) is passed on protectively as it is owned and is a form of intellectual property. In the modern context, an Aborigine cannot relate, or paint someone else's dreaming or creation story without prior permission of the Dreaming's owner. Someone's dreaming story must be respected, as the individual holds the knowledge to that Dreaming story. Certain behavioural constraints are associated with dreaming ownership; for instance, if a Dreaming is painted without authorisation, such action can meet with accusations of "stealing" someone else's Dreaming.</p>

<p>Dreaming represents many Aboriginal concepts of "time out of time,” or "everywhen,” when the land was inhabited by ancestral figures, often of heroic proportions or with supernatural abilities.</p>

<p>The term "Dreaming" is based on the root of the term <em>altjira</em> (<em>alcheringa</em>) used by the Aranda people, although it has since been pointed out that the rendition is based on a mistranslation. Anthropologist William Edward Hanley Stanner introduced the derived term of "Dreamtime" in the 1970s.</p>

<p>Dreamtime is commonly used as a term for the animist creation narrative of indigenous Australians for a personal, or group, creation and for what may be understood as the "timeless time" of formative creation and perpetual creating. In addition, the term applies to places and localities on indigenous Australian traditional land (and throughout nontraditional Australia) where the uncreated creation spirits and totemic ancestors, or <em>genii loci</em>, reside.</p>

<p>In Dreamtime, an individual's entire ancestry exists as one, culminating in the idea that all worldly knowledge is accumulated through one's ancestors. Dreamtime laid down the patterns of life for the Aboriginal people.</p>
