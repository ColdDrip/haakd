  <h2>How It Works</h2>

  <h3>Defining Dreamer's Core Aspects</h3>
  <p>Dreamer has three core aspects: orbs, the Dream Library, and the Pensieve.</p>

  <!-- <insert orb graphic><insert Dream Library graphic><insert Pensieve graphic> -->

  <p>Each orb represents a unique dream created by a Dreamer user. Any dream that you create on Dreamer will manifest in the form of an orb.</p>

  <p>The Dream Library, located at Dreamer’s homepage, is where all user-created dreams are stored as orbs on shelves.</p>

  <p>The Pensieve serves as a device for viewing dreams within the Dream Library and saving dreams to the Dream Library. Its name is a reference to the object of the same name in the Harry Potter series, which enabled non-participants to view others memories from a third-person perspective. To view dreams and publish your own created dreams, you must drag an orb to the Pensieve.</p>

  <h3>How to Use Dreamer</h3>
  <p>Dreamer can be used for two functions: adding dreams and exploring dreams.</p>

  <!-- <insert share dreams icon> <insert explore dreams icon> -->

  <h4>Adding Dreams</h4>
  <p>To add a dream, press the “add a dream” icon featured in the top right corner of the application. You will then be prompted to add a descriptive narrative of your dream, select the emotion you most associate with the dream, and choose two relevant images of artwork (sourced from Trove) based on your own selected keyword(s). Once these tasks have been completed, drag the orb to the Pensieve. This will send the orb to the Dream Library where it will emit a brighter glow than other orbs to indicate its position to you. Your dream will now be viewable by other Dreamer users.</p>

  <h4>Exploring Dreams</h4>
  <p>Explore the dream library by pressing your left and right arrow keys to peruse all shelves. Orbs will appear in the color associated with the dream they represent. Special orbs featuring Australian Aboriginal artwork and Dreamtime stories will appear in gold. Hovering over each orb will give you a preview of one of the images of artwork associated with the dream the orb represents.</p>

  <p>To view a dream, drag any orb on the shelves to the Pensieve.</p>

  <!-- <insert view a dream graphic> -->

  <p>To view your own dreams, visit the My Dreams page and drag any orb on the shelves to the Pensieve.</p>

  <!-- <insert view your own dream graphic> -->

  <p>The Pensieve will make visible all content associated with the dream the orb represents.</p>

  <h3>Use of Dreamer</h3>
  <p>Montague Ullman, notable psychoanalyst and founder of the Dream Laboratory, posits that “dream sharing bring[s] about rationality and connectedness in a highly irrational and disconnected world.”</p>

  <!-- <insert connectedness graphic> -->

  <p>Dreamer is designed for people desiring to share their dreams and be inspired by the dreams of others. It can also serve as a unique method of exploring artwork for art enthusiasts.</p>

  <p>In "Portents or Confessions: Authoritative Readings of a Dream Text,” Robin Wagner-Pacifici and Harold Bershady illuminate the ability of dream sharing to serve as a mechanism for fostering solidarity. They offer the perspective that dreams that are shared can in some way be viewed as “gifts.” From this perspective, Dreamer can be seen as platform for encouraging users to be both givers and receivers.</p>
