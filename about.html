  <h2>About</h2>

<p>Dreamer is web-based application created by Team HAAKD as part of the course DECO7180 Design Computing Studio 1 - Interactive Technology. The application enables users to share and explore dreams in a predominantly visual manner through the incorporation of artwork from Trove, a database maintained by the National Library of Australia.</p>

<p>We were inspired to create Dreamer after recognizing the mismatch between the ways in which dreams are portrayed in film and media and the ways in which dream-related applications are designed. In film and literature, dreams are often presented in very magical ways …yet most dream-related web applications present dreams in rather boring ways. These websites look more like pinboards and forums. While they may make dream sharing and dream exploration easy and convenient, they can be quite bland both in terms of visual design and interactions. In addition to this, the photos these websites utilize do not add any additional meaning to dreams and are typically overly literal. With Dreamer, we aim to change up the experience of sharing and exploring dreams on a web-based platform. We do this by purposefully connecting Trove artwork to users’ dreams to add new dimensions to these dreams. This provides Dreamer users with with a more visually rich experience that augments their own content.</p>

<p>Dreamer’s visual design has largely been inspired by the Pixar animated movie Inside Out, J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series, and the website I Remember. The application draws upon dream representations in film in media in order to construct a magical user experience. The employment of exploratory navigation is intended to make users feel as if they are immersed within an actual setting with shelves of glowing orbs, freely exploring dreams like one might explore books within a library.</p>

<p>In “Art, dreams and active imagination: A post-Jungian approach to transference and the image,” Joy Schaverien writes, “[D]reams ... are ultimately elusive, transient and can only be communicated if translated into the shared medium of spoken language. There is no public manifestation of an imagined event. However visualizations and dreams can sometimes be conveyed in pictures and, unlike mental imagery or dreams, art objects have a real, concrete, existence in the public arena. A picture is an object offered for the shared gaze and therefore it may be a bridge between inner and outer, between private and public experience.” Dreamer augments users’ dream descriptions by utilizing Trove’s artwork. Since, as Schaverien states, artwork has a “real, concrete, existence,” we believe that offering users complimentary artwork can allow for more meaning-making of rather “elusive” content.</p>

<p>With Dreamer, we hope to stimulate creativity amongst our audience by creating an alluring and immersive user experience through unique interactions and aesthetic appeal augmented by the wealth of artwork present within the Trove library.</p>
